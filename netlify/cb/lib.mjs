/* =============================================================================
   The CB — what every one of its functions shares.

   THE ONLY SERVER-SIDE CODE ON THIS SITE, and it is small on purpose. Everything
   else on stimpunks.world is a file Netlify serves as-is; this is the one place
   a request is answered by a program, and privacy.html says in plain words what
   it keeps. Every promise on that page is enforced here or in the functions
   beside it, so read that page before changing anything in this directory.

     · TEN MESSAGES AT MOST, AND NONE OF THEM PAST MIDNIGHT IN COLORADO. The whole
       channel is one JSON blob holding the day it belongs to and the latest ten
       messages. A read that finds yesterday's day returns nothing, and the hourly
       sweep deletes it. Nothing is archived, copied or backed up.
     · NO IP ADDRESS IS EVER STORED. Netlify's own rate limiter, declared in each
       function's config, is what stops somebody guessing the password; it counts
       addresses itself and never hands them to this code. Do not "improve" the
       limiter by keeping a list of addresses in a blob.
     · NOTHING A PERSON TYPES IS LOGGED. No console.log of a handle, a message, a
       password or a pass, anywhere. privacy.html promises it, and a log line is the
       easiest place in the world to break that promise while debugging.
     · THE CHALKBOARD KEEPS A WEEK, AND ANYBODY CAN READ IT. Helen Edgar's idea,
       after the board at her floatation tank place; the retention and the
       readership are Ryan's call, 2026-09-25. It is a second blob beside the
       channel: thirty notes at most, each rubbed out seven days after it was
       chalked, whether or not the sweep has got to it. Writing needs a pass,
       the same pass the radio uses; reading needs nothing, because a board on
       the pavement is read by whoever walks past, and privacy.html says so
       above the box you write in. Nothing else about it differs from the
       channel: no address, no log, no copy.
     · THE SLAKE, OUT THE BACK OF THE MUD ROOM, IS THE CB TOO. Ryan's calls,
       2026-09-27: you are seen by your handle only if you choose to be, on each
       visit, and each place on it has a channel of its own under the radio's
       rules. So presence is one tiny blob per visit, keyed so that a single
       listing says who is where, and it is shown to nobody thirty seconds after
       its last check and deleted by the next sweep at the latest; a place's talk
       is the channel's own blob shape, ten messages and gone at midnight. There
       is no list of everybody out there and no count of them, anywhere, and the
       places a visit has been are replaced rather than added to.
     · EVERY ROOM HAS A CHANNEL OF ITS OWN, BESIDE THE WORLD ONE. Ryan,
       2026-09-28: the radio tunes to World, the channel it always had, or to
       the room it is in, and a room's channel is the World channel's shape
       exactly, ten messages and gone at midnight in Colorado, in a blob of
       its own. Tuned to a room, the radio has to say which room it wants,
       every time it listens; tuned to World it says nothing about where it
       is. That difference is written on privacy.html, and it is why World is
       where a radio starts.
     · A HOST'S BEACON SAYS WHERE ONE FILM HAS GOT TO, AND NOTHING ELSE. Ryan,
       2026-09-28, for watch-togethers: somebody watching a film in a room can
       host it, and every radio then shows their place in it, with a way to
       catch up. One small blob holds every beacon on the street, one per room,
       each the handle, the room, the film, the place, whether it is playing
       and when it was last heard; each is REPLACED on every update, so there
       is no history of anybody's viewing, and one not heard from for
       seventy-five seconds is shown to nobody and dropped by the next write.
       The channel's answer carries all of them, so the radio never has to
       tell us which room anybody is in to find the beacon for theirs.
     · A PASS IS CHECKED AND NOT KEPT. It is an HMAC of the handle keyed by the
       current password, so changing the password in Netlify's environment and
       redeploying signs everybody off at once, and there is no list of passes
       anywhere to go stale or leak.
